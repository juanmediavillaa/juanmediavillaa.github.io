          <h3>Clothing Store</h3>
          <p>
            Established an online apparel store, relying on Shopify as the
            foundational platform for the e-store. Personally crafted all
            product designs employing various image editing tools. Fostered
            vital supplier connections through AliExpress and Alibaba,
            instrumental in sourcing quality inventory. Implemented PostNL for
            efficient product shipment, ensuring timely deliveries to customers.

          <h3>Bitcoin Trading Bot</h3>
          <p>
            Utilizing VSCode as the coding platform and Python as the
            programming language, I developed a program incorporating various
            standard technical analysis tools. These tools determined buy and
            sell signals within the market. To execute this program with real
            capital, I integrated the Binance API. To ensure uninterrupted
            operation, I maintained Google Cloud Servers running around the
            clock, enabling the continuous functionality of the trading bot.

          <h3>Investment Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            After years of studying I decided to finally put my knowledge to the
            test in the stock market and crypto market. Opted for a hybrid
            strategy of long term and short term holding, as well as the
            ocasional leveraged trade. Managed to achieve a return of 105.61%
            from the start of the year (01/01/2023) to the time of writing
            (23/11/2023). Remarkable trades include META (+172.37%) and BTC
            (+125.61%).
